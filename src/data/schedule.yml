  title: "Recovery, Restoration and Resilence-managing your mental health though COVID-19 and beyond"
  speaker: natalieadams
  description: |
    Mental wellbeing at work has been a big topic of the last few years but now with Covid 19 we are all facing huge changes to the way we work and communicate with others as well as the stress of living through a major pandemic.
    In this talk we will hear some of the ways the NHS have been using past crisis like the Ebola outbreak, war in Afghanistan and the Manchester Terrorist Bombings to consider the types of mental health support needed both for the general population and those working through the crisis. Natalie will share some practical advice around dealing with isolation, video call fatigue and the very normal but strong effect the pandemic is having on our psychological health and how we can all recover, restore and build our resilience.

  title: "P2P Matrix: Where we're going we don't need servers!"
  speaker: matthew
  description: |
    Matrix is an open protocol for decentralised communication, and since the start of 2020 the team has been seriously experimenting with evolving Matrix to work in peer-to-peer environments, giving users full control of their communications without any dependencies on the internet or service providers. In this talk we'll show off the latest implementations, and discuss how Matrix may become a hybrid federated/p2p network in future

  title: "Dialing back Telecoms: How to drive our industry back towards an open ecosystem."
  speaker: tony
  description: |
    Communication as a core principle is being able to get ideas out there. However, there is a risk that if we’re not aware of some of the trends being taken up, we’ll end up finding ourselves back to a walled garden.

    Telecoms as an industry has historically been one of the most open ecosystems with interoperability being achievable.  We’re now in a position where this industry has been leapfrogged by huge strives in the Cloud marketplace, to completely revolutionize the interconnectivity of systems.

  title: "SFrame.js: End to end encryption for everyone"
  speaker: sergio
  description: |
    Due to recent events, e2ee has become a must have in any videoconferencing service, even if your service does not have privacy and security as it's main use case.

    WebRTC has failed to provide a solution for e2ee in SFU scenarios until insertable streams has been implemented as an experimental feature in Chrome. From PERC to SFrame, we will be talking about what have been the different approaches to provide e2ee and posibles ways in which e2ee will evolve in the near future.

    Last, we will be covering a 1000ft view of what you would need to do to add e2ee support to your service SFrame.js, the pure javascript implementation of SFrame based on webcrypto.

    live events (e.g., IETF meetings) via WebRTC, facilitating remote participation.
    Then the world changed, and so must we. This talk will describe some of the strategies
    we followed to host completely virtual events using Janus.

  title: "Carrier-Grade: what does it mean to us, practically speaking?"
  speaker: max
  description: |
    Our belief is that software reliability is not just an "another feature"
    or "selling point" but ideology and the process. We will share few things and
    interesting techniques that we have discovered while implementing this vision.

  title: The pandemic, Zoom, and What’s next for RTC
  speaker: chad
  description: |
    The pandemic has increased the reliance on real time communications, but is this newfound usage evenly distributed? What industries, segments, and companies are leading the pack and what can we learn from them? Zoom in particular has become a household name, despite many high-profile issues. Can you replicate some of their success?  What’s next for the RTC industry after the pandemic? I will attempt to answer these questions and more with a data-driven approach.

  title: Using NodeRED as a Visual Asterisk Manager
  speaker: sammachin
  description: |
    I've spent a lot of time looking into visual low-code development tools and NodeRED is one of my favorites.
    Configuring and managing asterisk has always been a tricky task to understand and in many ways the config files are a form of 'code' Over the years several web based tools have emerged to make managing a PBX simpler. However these tools are usually built around a fairly specific use case. There are also new ways of managing your asterisk box through code in languages like javascript mostly using the ARI interface.
    I've started to experiment with what it would look like to manage asterisk via ARI inside NodeRED, trying to get the same level of power and flexibility from code based config with the ease of use from a visual tool.
    This talk is mostly going to be me asking a bunch of questions and showing the limited progress so far, so I would encourage people to join the discussion after the talk.
